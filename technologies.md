To implement a really large and complex software product (specially distributed and processing a lot of different data), it is necessary to use different technologies for storing, processing, analyzing and visualizing this data, for communication with other systems and users.

Therefore, I have practical experience with such technologies that I have used in projects:

## Programming languages
* Java 8-12 (more than 9 years of experience: Stream API, collections, generics, multithreading/concurrency, debugging, garbage collecting)
* Scala
* Groovy
* R (used only for log analysis, data visualization and analysis prototypes)

## Databases (RDBMS & NoSQL)
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* MongoDB

## Application Frameworks
* Spring (Core, Web, Integration, Boot)
* Dropwizard

## Distributed systems
* Apache Storm
* Apache Spark
* Apache Hadoop

## Message brokers
* Apache Kafka
* RabbitMQ

## Build systems
* Gradle
* Maven
* Ant

## Application servers / Cluster managers / Virtualization / etc
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* AWS
* Zookeeper
* WAS (WebSphere Application Server)
* YARN
* Google Cloud
* Tomcat
* JBoss
* ...

... and many other medium and small libraries and frameworks.
