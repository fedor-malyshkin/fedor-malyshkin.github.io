For implementing a really big and complex software product (specially distributed and processing a lot of different data) you have to use a different technologies to store, process, analyze and visualize these data, to communicate with other systems and users.

So I have practical experience with such technologies I used in projects:

## Programming languages
* Java (more than 5 years of experience: streams, collections, generics, multithreading/concurrent programming, debugging)
* Groovy
* Scala
* R (used only for log analysis, data visualization and analysis prototypes)

## Databases (RDBMS & NoSQL)
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* MongoDB

## Application Frameworks
* Spring (Core, Web, Integration, Boot)
* Dropwizard

## Distributed systems
* Apache Storm
* Apache Spark
* Apache Hadoop

## Message brokers
* RabbitMQ
* Apache Kafka

## Build systems
* Ant
* Maven
* Gradle

## Application servers / Cluster managers / Virtualization / etc
* JBoss
* Tomcat
* AWS
* Google Cloud
* YARN
* Docker
* Zookeeper
* ...

... and a lot of other medium and small libraries and products.
