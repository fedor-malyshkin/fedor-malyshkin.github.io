For implementing a really big and complex software product (specially distributed and processing a lot of different data) you have to use a different techonlogies to store, process, analyse and visualise these datas, to communicate with other systems and users.

So I have practical experience with such technologies I used in projects:

## Programming languages

## Databases

## Application Frameworks

## Distribution systems???

## Message ????

## Build systems

## Monitoring systems
