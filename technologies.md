To implement a huge and complex software product (especially distributed and processing a lot of different data), it is necessary to use different technologies for storing, processing, transferring, analyzing and visualizing the data.

Therefore, I have practical experience with such technologies that I have used in other projects:

## Programming languages
* Java 8-12 (more than 9 years of experience: Stream API, collections, generics, multithreading/concurrency, debugging, garbage collecting)
* Scala
* Groovy (mostly for scripting some routine tasks of scripting support inside application)
* Python (mostly for scripting some routine tasks or prototyping)
* R (used only for log analysis, data visualization and analysis prototypes)

## Databases (RDBMS & NoSQL)
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* MongoDB

## Application Frameworks
* Spring (Core, Web, Integration, Boot)
* Dropwizard
* Akka, Akka HTTP

## Distributed systems
* Apache Storm
* Apache Spark
* Apache Hadoop

## Message brokers
* Apache Kafka
* RabbitMQ

## Build systems
* Gradle
* Maven
* Ant

## Application servers / Cluster managers / Virtualization / etc
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* AWS
* Zookeeper
* WAS (WebSphere Application Server)
* YARN
* Google Cloud
* Tomcat
* JBoss
* ...

... and many other medium and small libraries and frameworks.
