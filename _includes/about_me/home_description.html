<p>I can describe myself as a software developer with wide experience not only in software development, but also in
    supporting production system, who tries to understand and combine needs of developers and engineers. For getting
    this experience I worked as a senior software developer for 4 years in a small startup, as an engineer in Russia's
    state bank and again as senior software engineer. In 2015, I decided to start
    <a href="https://fedor-malyshkin.github.io/story_line2_build/">my side-project</a> which I was doing in my spare
    time. In this project, I was trying to combine needs of developers and engineers – so I used there the best
    development
    practices (like test-development, continuous integration, event-based workflows and so on) and engineering practices
    (containerization, auto-provisioning and monitoring).</p>
<p>Most of the time I'm working on Java, but I see bright future for Scala and decided to add it to my stack.
    Therefore, I am very interested in the projects where I can improve this skill.</p>

<p>I have worked a lot with relational and non-relational databases,
    message brokers, build systems, version control systems. Of course, I’m using testing and code-review in my work.
