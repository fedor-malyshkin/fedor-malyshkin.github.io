<p>I can describe myself as a software developer with wide experience not only in software development, but also in supporting production system, who tries to understand and combine needs of developers and engineers. For getting this experience I worked as senior software developer for 4 years in <a href="http://www.magnetosoft.ru">small startup</a>, which had been developing document management system. Several years ago I decided to start <a href="https://fedor-malyshkin.github.io/story_line2_build/">my side-project</a> which I make in my spare time. In this project, Im trying to combine needs of developers and engineers – so I use there the best development practices (like test-development, continuous integration, event-based workflows and so on) and engineering practices (containerization, auto-provisioning and monitoring).</p>
<p>Most of the time I'm working on Java, but some time before I decided to study Scala and started using it in <a href="https://fedor-malyshkin.github.io/story_line2_build/">my practice</a>. Therefore, I am very interested in the projects where I can improve this skill. I have worked a lot with relational and non-relational databases, message brokers, build systems, version control systems. And of course I’m using testing and code-review in my work.</p>
