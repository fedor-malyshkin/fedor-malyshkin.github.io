<p>I can describe myself as a programmer with wide experience not only in software development, but also in supporting production system, who tries to understand and combine needs of developers and engineers. For getting this experience I worked as senior programmer for 4 years in <a href="http://www.magnetosoft.ru">small startup</a>, which had been developing document management system. Several years ago I decided to start <a href="/projects/story_line2">my side-project</a> which I make in my spare time. In this project, I try to combine needs of developers and engineers – so I use there last development practices (like test-development, continuous integration, event-based workflows and so on and so forth) and engineer practices (containerization, measurement, auto-provisioning and monitoring).</p>
<p>Most of the time I was working on Java, but some time before I decided to study Scala and started using it in <a href="/projects/story_line2">my practice</a>. Therefore, I am very interested in project where I can improve this skill. I have worked quite a lot with relational and non-relational databases, message brokers, build systems, version control systems. I’m using testing and code-review in my work.</p>
