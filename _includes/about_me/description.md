I can describe myself as a programmer with wide experience not only in software development, but also in supporting production system, who tries to understand and combine needs of developers and engineers. For getting this experience I worked as senior programmer for 4 years in [small startup](http://www.magnetosoft.ru), which had been developing document management system. After that, I got job in branch of [Central bank of Russia](www.cbr.ru) where I was responsible for management IT-infrastructure group. However, several years ago I decided to return back to developer's career and start [my side-project](/projects/story_line2.html) which I make in my spare time. In this project, I try to combine needs of developers and engineers – so I use there last development practices (like test-development, continuous integration, event-based workflows and so on and so forth) and engineer practices (containerization, measurement, auto-provisioning and monitoring).

Another very interesting theme for me it’s machine learning, which I believe will be necessary for every programmer in near future (5-10 years).

Most of the time I was working on Java, but some time before I decided to study Scala and started using it in my practice. Therefore, I am very interested in project where I can improve this skill. I have worked quite a lot with relational and non-relational databases, message brokers, build systems, version control systems. I’m using testing and code-review in my work.
